			<h1>Rules of Probability</h1><br>
			<p>The rules of probability are useful for expressing the likelihood of a certain event occuring. To calculate
				the probability of an event, one would find the number of times a certain event occurs and then divide that 
				quantity by the number of all possible outcomes. For example, if a person were to buy five lottery tickets and
				there are 100 million tickets in circulation then the odds of that person having the winning ticket would
				be 1/20,000,000.</p><br>
			<h2>The Multiplication Rule</h2>
			<p class="italic">The probability of two or more independent events occuring together is found by multiplying their 
				respective probabilities.</p><br>
			<p>To illustrate this principle, here are a few examples: </p>
			
			<br>
			<h2>The Addition Rule</h2>
			<p class="italic">The probability of any one of several different outcomes occuring is found by adding the
				probabilities of these events.</p>
