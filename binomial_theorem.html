			<div><h1>The Binomial Expansion and Probability</h1></div><br>
			<p>When using probability, it is important to remember that there are several different ways in which events can occur. Consider the following example: </p><br>
			<h2>Lactose Intolerance</h2>
			<p>Lactase persistence is the continued ability of the enzyme lactase in adulthood. In many mammalian species the activity of this enzyme is reduced after weaning
				because its only purpose is to help digest the lactose found in milk. However some human populations have developed the ability to digest lactose well into adulthood.
				Lactose persistence is dominant over the inability to digest lactose (hypolactasia).</p><br>
			<p>When two parents heterozygous for lactase persistence mate (Ll x Ll), the probability of having a child with lactase persistence is 3/4 (LL or Ll) and the probability 
				of having a child with hypolactasia is 1/4 (ll). </p><br>
			<p>Suppose we wish to find the probability of this couple having three children who are all lactose-intolerant. In this
				case we can simply use the multiplication rule: 1/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/64.</p><br>
			<p>Next, we might ask "What is the probability of this couple having three children, one who is lactose-peristent and two who are lactose-intolerant?"</p><br>
			<p>This situation requires three uses of the multiplication rule for each possibility - the first child is lactose-persistent and the other two are lactose-intolerant, or
				the second child is lactose-persistent and the first and third child are lactose-intolerant, or the third child is the only one that is lactose-persistent.</p><br>
			<p>We would see something like this: 3/4 x 1/4 x 1/4 = 3/64 (Case one) + 1/4 x 3/4 x 1/4 (Case two) + 1/4 x 1/4 x 3/4 (Case three) which gives us a sum total of 9/64.</p><br>
			<p>Because the complexity of this situation increases dramatically for each additional possibility, it is necessary to use a formula for problems involving more variables.</p><br>
